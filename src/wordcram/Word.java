/**
 * A weighted word, for rendering in the word cloud image.
 * <p>
 * Each Word object has a {@link #word} String, and its associated {@link #weight}, and it's constructed
 * with these two things.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Hand-crafting Your Words</h3>
 *
 * If you're creating your own <code>Word[]</code> to pass
 * to the WordCram (rather than using something like {@link WordCram#fromWebPage(String)}),
 * you can specify how a Word should be rendered: set a Word's font, size, etc:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Word w = new Word("texty", 20);
 * w.setFont(createFont("myFontName", 1));
 * w.setAngle(radians(45));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Any values set on a Word will override the corresponding component ({@link WordColorer},
 * {@link WordAngler}, etc) - it won't even be called for that word.
 *
 * <h3>Word Properties</h3>
 * A word can also have properties. If you're creating custom components,
 * you might want to send other information along with the word, for the components to use:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Word strawberry = new Word("strawberry", 10);
 * strawberry.setProperty("isFruit", true);
 *
 * Word pea = new Word("pea", 10);
 * pea.setProperty("isFruit", false);
 *
 * new WordCram(this)
 *   .fromWords(new Word[] { strawberry, pea })
 *   .withColorer(new WordColorer() {
 *      public int colorFor(Word w) {
 *        if (w.getProperty("isFruit") == true) {
 *          return color(255, 0, 0);
 *        }
 *        else {
 *          return color(0, 200, 0);
 *        }
 *      }
 *    });
 * </pre>
