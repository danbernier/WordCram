Release notes for WordCram 0.4, Spring 2011:

WordCram 0.4 changes center around three themes: setting rendering
options on words directly (rather than through components);
information on whether a Word was placed or skipped, and why; and
finer control over the rendering process.

* Word now has methods getProperty(String name) and setProperty(String
  name, Object value).  The firstnamesUsingWordProperties example
  sketch shows how it works. Properties can be useful with a custom
  WordPlacer, WordColorer, etc.

* Word also now has methods setSize(), etc..., and getRenderedSize(),
  etc...

* Added getWordAt(x,y).

* Added getSkippedWords(), which returns a Word[] of all words that
  were (so far) skipped, and getWords(), which returns a Word[] of all
  words the WordCram is looking at.

* Added withCustomCanvas(PGraphics), so a WordCram can be drawn to a
  PGraphics besides the sketch it's running in. Also added
  getProgress(), which can help provide feedback on long-running
  WordCrams to a custom canvas.

* Added withMaxAttemptsForPlacement(int), which tells WordCram to only
  try so many times to place a word.

* Added maxNumberOfWordsToDraw(int), which limits how many words
  WordCram will try to draw.

* Added minShapeSize(int), to weed out words that render to Shapes
  smaller than the given size.

* Back-ported to run on Java 1.5, to match Processing.

* Deleted deprecated methods currentWord() and currentWordIndex().


Release notes for WordCram 0.3.1, 2010-11-10:

* Bug fix: in 0.3, the WordCram library folder under Processing was 
  renamed from wordcram to WordCram, but the .jar was still 
  wordcram.jar, so Processing didn't load it.  Renamed it to 
  WordCram.jar.


Release notes for WordCram 0.3, 2010-11-07:

* Added TextSource, so WordCram can count words from different kinds
  of source, including web pages and text files.
* Added a fluent API for building WordCrams: 
  new WordCram(this).forWebPage("{url}").sizedByWeight(10, 100).
* Added case-sensitive word counting, and the ability to exclude
  numeric words.
* Added javadoc comments for lots of classes -- more to come.
* Added Processing examples: in Processing, look under File >
  Sketchbook > libraries > WordCram > examples.
* Bug fix: issue 1, Stop-words with punctuation have no effect.
* Added StopWords.JAVA for making WordCrams from java source code.
* Added Anglers.heaped(), Anglers.randomBetween(min,max),
  Colorers.twoHuesRandomSatsOnWhite(), and
  Placers.horizBandAnchoredLeft().
* Deprecated old WordCram constructors, WordCram.currentWord(), and
  WordCram.currentWordIndex().
* Changed minimum shape size from 4 to 7, to speed up rendering.
* WaveWordPlacer and SwirlWordPlacer no longer randomly offset
  placement, so they should look crisper.
* Improved SpiralWordNudger's spiralling, so more words should show,
  and faster.
